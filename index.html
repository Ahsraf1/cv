  <h2>Education</h2>
  <p>Right now my education status is not that murch strong but still its good.
    <br>
    In <strong>Uganda</strong>we have different levels of Education and this are the one i have gone through soffer;
  <ul>
    <li><strong>primary level</strong><br>
      <p>
        I did my PLE at Our Lady Primary School in 2013, <br>
        By then the school had not yet got the regetration center number we where regestered at Ssekibobo Primary school.
        Here i was able to get a second gread(2<sup>nd</sup>).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>secondary level</strong>
      <p>After my primary i joined <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0m_n01vtvc"> Mpoma Royal Collage</a> in 2014-2015 for S1 & S2 and finshed my S3 & S4 from
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yps91t6WRb8">Panorama s.s.s</a> in 2016-2017.
        <br>Here i obtained a 3<sup>rd</sup> gread.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Advanced level(A. level)</strong>
      <p>
        After a period of 1 year berfor joining any Institute nor an A.level School,
        I decieded to join an Institute becouse I knew that I would not get what I wanted in a.level.
        Now I just dont regreat in me choosing this course, it is then forwarding me closer to my dreams of
        becoming a <strong>great web developer</strong>.<br>
        <strong>NOTE</strong><br>
        <strong><em>our dear perant here i advise u not to force your children to go for what they never wanted</em></strong>
